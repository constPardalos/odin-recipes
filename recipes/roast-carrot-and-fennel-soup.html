        <h2>About this recipe</h2>
        <p>A sweet and aromatic soup with super-easy flatbreads for dunking.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 kg carrots</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>2 bulbs of fennel</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>1.6 litres organic vegetable stock</li>
            <li>100 ml single cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
            <li>250 g strong bread flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon fast-action dried yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5.</li>
            <li>Peel the carrots and onion, then trim and slice along with the fennel (reserving any herby tops, to garnish). Place in a roasting dish, toss with 2 tablespoons of oil.</li>
            <li>Roast for 20 minutes, then add the unpeeled garlic cloves. Stir everything thoroughly and return to the oven for 20 minutes more, or until the vegetables are soft and browned.</li>
            <li>Remove and discard the papery skins from the garlic cloves. Put the roasted veg in a large pan with the vegetable stock and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 15 minutes, then liquidise with a stick blender, until completely smooth.</li>
            <li>To make the flatbreads, toast the fennel seeds in a dry frying pan for 30 seconds or so, until fragrant. Crush roughly with a pestle and mortar, then pour into a bowl with the flour and ½ teaspoon of sea salt.</li>
            <li>Dissolve the yeast and sugar in 100ml of hand-hot (not boiling) water, then add it to the flour mixture with the oil and 60 to 75ml of hot water and mix until you have a soft, but not sticky, dough. Knead for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pop the dough into an oiled bowl, cover with oiled clingfilm and set aside to rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Then, with oiled hands, divide the dough into 8 and roughly roll each one into a thin oval. Stack them up, separating them with baking paper to stop them from sticking together.</li>
            <li>Heat a griddle pan until it’s smoking hot and add the flatbreads (you’ll need to do this in batches). Cook for a couple of minutes on each side, until charred and puffed up. Keep warm in a tea towel while cooking the rest.</li>
            <li>Gently reheat the soup, and serve with a swirl of cream, a scattering of herby fennel tops (if you have them) and the hot flatbreads.</li>
        </ol>
