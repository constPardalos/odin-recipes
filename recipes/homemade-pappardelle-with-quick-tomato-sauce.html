        <h2>About this recipe</h2>
        <p>This tomato sauce may be simple, but boy does it taste special! I love the fresh chill kick.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic , peeled and finely sliced</li>
            <li>½-1 fresh red chilli , halved, deseeded and finely sliced</li>
            <li>1 small bunch of fresh basil , leaves picked</li>
            <li>400 g good-quality tinned chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>sea salt</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>250 g fresh lasagne sheets</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese , freshly grated, to serve</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large frying pan over a medium heat and add a good few lugs of olive oil. When the oil’s hot, add the garlic and chilli and fry until lightly coloured.</li>
            <li>Drop in most of the basil – stand back as it will crackle and spit in the oil – and then, after a few seconds, add the tomatoes. Bring to the boil and simmer for about 5 minutes. You’ll end up with a chunky sauce – if you like it smoother, pass the sauce through a coarse sieve. Taste the sauce and season with salt and pepper. Keep warm.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. On a lightly floured work surface, cut the lasagne sheets into strips with a knife or a pastry wheel. When the water is at a rolling boil, add the pasta and cook for a few minutes until just al dente.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta strips in a colander, reserving a little of the cooking water.</li>
            <li>Stir the pasta into the warm sauce. If it’s a bit thick, add a few spoonfuls of the cooking water to loosen it up. Sprinkle with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and the reserved basil leaves and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
