        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large bunch of asparagus , (16 spears)</li>
            <li>8 slices of higher-welfare pancetta</li>
            <li>4 large free-range eggs</li>
            <li>4 slices of wholemeal bread , (50g each)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a griddle pan over a high heat to heat up.</li>
            <li>Snap the woody ends off the asparagus and discard.</li>
            <li>Fill a medium saucepan three-quarters of the way up with water, add a pinch of sea salt, then place over a high heat and bring to a fast boil.</li>
            <li>On a chopping board, slice the pancetta in half across the middle, so you end up with 16 pieces, then gently stretch out each one.</li>
            <li>Wrap each asparagus spear in a piece of pancetta, then place onto the hot griddle and cook for 5 minutes, or until the asparagus is tender and the pancetta is crisp, turning occasionally.</li>
            <li>One at a time, place the eggs onto a spoon, then carefully dip in and out of the boiling water a few times – dipping will reduce the temperature shock and stop them from cracking – then gently lower into the pan.</li>
            <li>Cook the eggs for 5½ minutes so that they’re runny for dunking – set a timer.</li>
            <li>Carefully remove the eggs from the water and place into egg cups set on a plate, then divide up the asparagus.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, quickly toast the bread on the griddle for 30 seconds on each side. Remove from the pan, slice into soldiers on a clean board and divide between your plates.</li>
            <li>Lightly tap and remove the top of each egg, season with black pepper, then tuck in.</li>
        </ol>
