This is an assignment from the Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes) 
to practice the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.

The purpose of this assignment is to build a simple HTML page that includes links to recipes. Each recipe has its own page with an image, description, ingredients etc.
The pages should be properly structured, using the correct element types and then styled with CSS.
